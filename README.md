# WeatherApp - Java API Integration Project

## ðŸ“‹ Description

**WeatherApp** is a Java console application that integrates the **Visual Crossing Weather API** to fetch and display real-time weather forecasts. The app allows users to input any city, view daily weather data, filter hot days based on a temperature threshold, and calculate the average temperature over a forecast period.

This project was created for a **Software Engineering API Assignment** to demonstrate real-world API integration, JSON processing, and data analysis using Java.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

1. **Fetch Real-Time Weather Data:**
   - Retrieves daily weather forecasts including temperature and humidity for the next 15 days for any city.

2. **Hot Day Filter:**
   - Users can input a temperature threshold (in Â°F), and the app displays only the days where the temperature exceeds that threshold.

3. **Average Temperature Calculator:**
   - Computes and displays the average temperature over the forecast period.
