# WeatherApp - Java API Integration Project

## ðŸ“‹ Description

**WeatherApp** is a Java console application that integrates the **Visual Crossing Weather API** to fetch and display real-time weather forecasts. The app allows users to input any city, view daily weather data, filter hot days based on a temperature threshold, and calculate the average temperature over a forecast period.

This project was created for a **Software Engineering API Assignment** to demonstrate real-world API integration, JSON processing, and data analysis using Java.
